    <h1>Where the data comes from</h1>
    <div class="box">
<p> We collected the number of citations and publications for each author from different sources. We present them ordered in terms of their MathSciNet citations. They count citations from papers published in mathematical journals and it seems to be most reliable.</p>
<p>The year of graduation is taken from the <a href="https://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/">Math Genealogy project</a>. In those cases when we could not find a record in the Math Genealogy project, we used the year of the first publication listed on MathSciNet. This is the case in about 5% of the records, so there are some inaccuracies.</p>
<p>The area is guessed from the MSC codes of publications. It is rather inexact. Some people are impossible to classify. Terence Tao and Jean Bourgain are listed both in analysis and number theory. Other people are not listed in any subject. We apologize, but we find it very complicated to give a fair classification to everybody. We found the need to attempt to classify people because there is a correlation between area and citations. Otherwise we would rarely see algebraists in our list. We understand the area marked as Geometry/Topology/Dynamical Systems puts together very dissimilar subjects, but it is difficult to differentiate them fairly based on their MSC code only.</p>
<p>If you click at any of the names, a dialog will show you the number of publications and citations of the corresponding author, as well as links to their profiles on <a href="https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/">Mathscinet</a>, <a href="https://www.scopus.com/">Scopus</a>, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/">ResearchGate</a> and <a href="http://scholar.google.com">Google Scholar</a> when available. Note that some of these are subscription services. What you are able to see depends on your subscription status.</p>
<p>We collected the data purely out of curiosity. This site is not affiliated with the AMS, the Math Genealogy project, Elsevier, ResearchGate or Google.</p>
