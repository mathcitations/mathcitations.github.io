<!-- <p>Is the number of citations equivalent to the quality of the work of a mathematician? We are fully aware that it is not. It is an easy exercise to find a great mathematician who is nowhere in this list. The only way to evaluate accurately the work of a mathematician is by reading and understanding his/her work. Unfortunately, it is not always practical. People resort to all sorts of quantifications like the number of publications, quality of journals, affiliation, prizes, and letters of recommendations. All these methods are flawed and biased in their own way. Interestingly, most prize winners are among the top cited mathematicians of their graduation year. This indicates a positive correlation between all these measures and is reassuring.</p>
<p>It might be possible to artificially manipulate the citation index and perhaps it is already happening. It is also quite noticeable that some areas of mathematics receive more citations than others.</p> -->
